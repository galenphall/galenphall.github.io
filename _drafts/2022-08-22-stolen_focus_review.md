For my first post on this site, a short review of Johann Hari's _Stolen Focus_, which I read last week. I'm trying to start this blog off with some quick and mediocre content to keep the bar low, keep my perfectionism at bay, and keep me writing. Let's go!

A family member recommended _Stolen Focus_ to me, likely because social media and its seemingly poisonous effect on various aspects of cognition has long held a central place among my family's rotation of rant topics. When they made the recommendation I don't think they were aware of Hari's somewhat troubled history in popular writing: according to [his Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Hari) _The Independent_ suspended him after bloggers and an unaffiliated editor pointed out several instances of plagiarism in Hari's work. Hari's pattern of misquoting and outright fabrication seems to have been a [major scandal](https://www.commentary.org/articles/jonathan-foreman/dirty-hari/) in British journalism, although one could be forgiven for forgetting it amidst a much larger scandal surrounding cell phone hacking committed on behalf of a tabloid newspaper. Critics have consequently remained alert to futher inaccuracies or outright lies in Hari's work, and his two books prior to _Stolen Focus_ -- one on the war on drugs and another on depression and anxiety -- both earned skeptical if not outright damning remarks from writers and scientists alike. It's not that Hari spreads fake news or systematically lies; rather, he looks like a writer who approaches topics with a conclusion and possibly a conceptual framework already built, and then somewhat indiscriminately gathers material for a factual foundation. In other words, read with caution.

_Stolen Focus_ primarily deals with the negative impacts social media imposes on users' attention. Personally I feel deeply skeptical of social media and suspect its effects on cognition, social funcitioning and human fulfillment are not worth the alleged benefits it brings to society (at least in the developed world - more on that in a moment). Hari shares my view. I therefore started this book looking forward to that glowing feeling one gets upon having all their priors confirmed in glorious detail. And to an extent that happened. The first half of the book explains several ways in which the engine of modernity has quickened the pace of life. Digital media -- including social media, but also things like television and email -- have acted as an accelerant kicking that engine into overdrive, and Hari worries about potentially disastrous results for our attention spans, our ability to engage in both mind wandering and deep flow-state activities, and consequently for society. He interweaves fairly effective anecdotes from his own three month stint living in Provincetown totally disconnected from digital media and the internet.
