Thinking through the links between our attentional crisis, climate change, and degrowth.
=====

# Unstructured notes

## Tech

* 12 different sources of attentional crisis (perhaps better called a cognitive crisis):
  1. Increase in speed, filtering, and switching (constant income of information from different streams, and switching between streams)
  2. Crippling of flow states (flow states require prolonged attention and lack of disruptions)
  3. Physical and mental exhaustion (lack of sleep)
  4. Collapse of sustained reading
  5. Disruption of mind-wandering
  6. Rise of technology that can track and manipulate you (two chapters)
  7. Rise of cruel optimism re: the above
  8. Increase in stress --> vigilance responses
    * While the link between stress and attention seems strong, also strong argument that overall sources of stress have decreased dramatically over past couple of centuries in developed societies. Of course this is an empirical claim which could be directly tested -- maybe things we assume caused attention-leeching stress in the past in fact didn't.
  9. Deteriorating diets
  10. Rising pollution
    * Many forms of pollution in developed countries have decreased since the 70's. But perhaps different kinds of pollution have greater or lesser affects on focus.
  11. Rising ADHD diagnoses and stimulant prescriptions
  12. Physical and psychological confinement of children.

* Solutions
  1. Federal government could pass a law banning surveillance capitalism as a business model, or significantly constraining it.
    * This will not happen without widespread public demands, at least not in a quasi-democratic society.
    * Similar to former social movements, some form of legal prohibition is likely the end goal but right now the movement is at best in the early consciousness-raising stages. 
  2. Individual actions
    * Limiting social media use, limiting screen time generally, making space for deep reading, flow states, etc.
    * Certainly helpful, when possible -- but cutting against the grain
    * (I would argue) especially important for those involved in the fight against social media to limit their use of it. Both to model the benefits and plausibility of their goal for society, and because dependence on social media breeds transient social movements without staying power.

## Topics to cover

* Climate crisis
* Cognitive crisis
* Surveillance capitalism
* Social movement theory and timelines
  * Abolition in Britain as an example
* Similarities/differences between cognitive and climate crises
  * Similarities in technological bases
    * Spread of new technology using network effects
      * Especially obvious in some cases: utility companies, social media companies
      * Perhaps roads/cars
      * Generates firms with extremely concentrated wealth and political power
    * Reorganization of basic infrastructure of life
      * And of business: most businesses totally reliant on fossil fuels, and many becoming reliant on social media
    * Potentially enormous "Externalities"
    * Obvious benefits, especially for the worst-off
      * Therefore easy to level Luddite insults at people warning of dangers
    * Behaviors of responsible elites: obviously aware of dangers and taking steps to protect themselves
    * Rhetoric of individual responsibility
    * Reliance on state funding for infrastructure or R&D
    * Industry-funded attempts to dispute or negate science warning of impacts
  * Differences
    * Obvious one: internet not as resource dependent
    * Social media fundamentally about advertising _other_ goods/services
    * At least so far, social media not as bound up in geopolitics; there are no nationalized tech companies (right? China?)
    * Social media use imposes individual costs at least on some accounts -- more like a drug
    * As of now the scale and nature of the cognitive crisis is hard to systematically define/measure, whereas climate crisis is scientifically uncontested
    * __Role of labor power__ 
      * Labor power no longer important in fossil fuel industry, but it once was
      * Argument that coal workers were backbone of labor movement, in large part because of the disruptive capacity afforded to them by the nature of coal production
      * Labor power has essentially no role in tech right now
      * Tech workers are some of the most empowered in the world -- high pay, lots of benefits. Mostly thought to be due to long time scarcity of tech workers, though this is changing as more people get qualifications and work becomes less skilled.
      * Tech workers also have huge disruptive capacity which has never been used. 
* Utility companies and natural monopolies/network effects
  * Utility companies created the idea of a natural monopoly (check)
  * But both utility companies and social media benefit from network effects: the larger they grow the greater their power and influence, and the larger the costs to people of not using their products or of going with the competition
  * Network effects generate politically powerful actors
    * Uber compelling New Yorkers to vote against De Blasio (check)
    * Cases of utility companies using consumers?
  * Regulation can be a dangerous game
    * Regulation generally deemed better than the Texas alternative for utility companies, but Texas utilities have less political clout (check)
    * In general, regulation runs the risk of creating economically protected interests with control over major infrastructure, overseen by government agencies without the expertise or funding (and possibily incentive) to carry out their duties on behalf of the public, and thus prone to capture.
      * See this in the case of utility companies which routinely threaten the public with higher prices, even though the prices and thus their rate of profit are literally set by the government which claims to act on behalf of the public -- if prices are higher it is only to maintain utility company profits.
    * Straightforward nationalization may be a better model so that the profit motive is removed entirely. (Look into research on this count.)
* Apparently positive role of tech companies in climate change advocacy (e.g. WV vs EPA amici brief, as one example)
  * Examples
    * WV vs EPA amici brief
    * Google renewable energy use
  * Why?
    * PR - seeking to maintain image as progressive forces and thus social license within the elite
    * Generally progressive workforce with some labor power
* Social media's distortion of social movements
* Degrowth and the degrowth movement
  * What growth actually is
  * Problems with degrowth
    * Branding problem
    * Theory of change: no social forces named
      * Purely ideological
      * Examples of Marx and other socialists' contempt for such theories.
* Individual action
