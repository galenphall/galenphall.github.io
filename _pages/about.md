I do social science. Right now I'm focused on climate change politics in the United States, which I take to be one of the more pressing problems to understand. More generally I'm interested in using the proliferation of human surveillance data to detect and explain universal trends in human behavior. Other interests which have taken back stage for the moment: physics (my undergraduate degree), particularly fundamental physics and the philosophy of QM; political theory; consciousness; fine art. The climate crisis and social instability are my main motivators. If there were no problems in the world I would probably just paint and run.
